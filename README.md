# Crossql
Crossql will assist astronomers in dealing with automated sky data crossmatching within astronomical databases.

# Intended Audience
Astronomers and the wider scientific community.

# Intended Use
To facilitate the crossmatch of two or more tables in a postgres database producing a third table with the results of the crossmatch. The crossmatch will operate on the positions of the objects of the sky and these positions are encoded into angles. 

# Scope
Crossql will be used within databases for astronomical data and will handle at least one million rows within a single table at a time.
